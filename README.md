The goal of speechiespeech is to allow a user to easily parse text from
public websites and perform basic text mining and analysis functions
including tokenizing a text file, performing and visualizing sentiment
analysis, and analyzing relative frequency of words across a set of
source documents. It is meant to be accessible to a beginner R user, and
as such will focus on developing wrappers for more flexible functions
and packages from the tidyverse
